# MakeItRain
This is a project for a DIY multinode watering system like rainbird or whatever the other ones are. Using MQTT to control the valves or reading the local inputs from the device. will work with 12 or 24 volt (DC) systems. These can be set up remotely with a solar panel and a decent sized battery (solar charger not included)
